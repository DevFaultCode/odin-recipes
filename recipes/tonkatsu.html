    <h1>Tonkatsu</h1>
    <img src="../images/chuletas-de-cerdo-tonkatsu-scaled.png" alt="Tonkatsu">
    <p> is a Japanese dish that consists of a breaded, deep-fried pork cutlet. It involves coating slices of pork with panko (bread crumbs), and then frying them in oil. The two main types are fillet and loin. Tonkatsu is also the basis of other dishes such as katsukarē and katsudon.</p>

    <h2>Ingredient:</h2>
    <h3>Pork</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>2 cups vegetable oil, for deep-fat frying</li>
        <li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ cup panko bread crumbs</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
        <li>1 Porkchop</li>
        <li>1 green onion, thinly sliced</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Sauce:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>¼ cup ketchup</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>For the sauce, stir together the Worcestershire sauce, ketchup, and soy sauce, and a pinch of pepper to taste. Set aside.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Heat oil in deep-fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Place flour and panko bread crumbs onto separate plates and season with salt and pepper. Place the beaten egg in a medium bowl. Dip flattened porkchop first into flour, then egg, and lastly bread crumbs.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Fry breaded porkchop in preheated oil until golden brown and no longer pink in center, about 8 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to absorb excess oil. Slice the porkchop into thin strips and top with a drizzle of sauce and a sprinkling of sliced green onions. Serve remaining sauce on the side for dipping.</p>
